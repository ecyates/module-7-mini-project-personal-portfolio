    <br/><hr><h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
    <hr><h3><strong>Professional Summary</strong></h3>
    <p>Adaptable and bilingual professional with a background in financial editing, process automation, 
        and data-driven problem-solving, now transitioning into software engineering through Coding Temple's 
        intensive bootcamp. Skilled in leveraging analytical and technical expertise, with hands-on experience in 
        Python, SQL, VBA, and workflow automation. Passionate about bringing a unique blend of language and 
        programming skills to build innovative, efficient solutions. </p>

    <hr><h3><strong>Personal Summary</strong></h3>
    <p>After more than a decade of incredible life experiences abroad, I'm taking a leap into a long-held dream 
        by enrolling in Coding Temple's Software Engineering program. My journey here has been anything but straightforward, 
        starting 15 years ago in college with a double major in Mathematics and Spanish Literature. 
        Although I initially set my sights on teaching, an Intro to Computer Science course I took unexpectedly 
        hooked me with its perfect blend of language and problem-solving, sparking a love for programming that 
        I carried with me as I explored other paths.</p>

    <p>When graduation arrived, I chose to follow a different dream: travel. I moved to Chile to teach English, 
        where, in my first two weeks, I met the love of my life. Together, we spent a year exploring 15 countries, 
        culminating in a proposal at the Taj Mahal (if you'd like to see more about our travels, see 
        <a href="2016-travel-blog.html">here</a>) 
        and ultimately building a life in coastal Chile, where we married 
        (three times!) and welcomed our two children.</p>
        
    <p>In Chile, I found a rewarding role as a financial editor that harnessed my love for language, 
        detail, and tech-savvy problem-solving. Over my six years at Evalueserve, I trained in VBA, 
        created automations, and consolidated workflows across various platformsâ€”all the while growing 
        my technical skills and refining my professional focus.</p>
        
    <p>But with each passing year, my heart tugged me back toward home in the Pacific Northwest. 
        After a decade in Chile, my family and I finally relocated to Portland, where I now get to share daily 
        life with my parents and siblings. It's been a year of growth, adaptation, and fresh starts, 
        including joining Coding Temple to pursue a software engineering career. I feel incredibly fortunate to 
        be back at home, alongside my kids' first steps into school and daycare, and embracing my own exciting 
        new chapter in tech.</p>
        
    <p>Wish me luck on this next adventure! ðŸš€</p>
